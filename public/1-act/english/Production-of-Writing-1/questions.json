      "passageHtml": "To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile. [highlight-1]The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are inaccessible; [/highlight-1]but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood.\n<div style=\"margin: 8px 0;\"></div>\nWhen we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by manifold natural objects. [highlight-2]It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet.[/highlight-2] The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is indubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these men's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.\n<div style=\"margin: 8px 0;\"></div>\nTo speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. [highlight-3]The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child.[/highlight-3] The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says,—he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me. [highlight-4]Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight.[/highlight-4]\n<div style=\"margin: 8px 0;\"></div>\nCrossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. [highlight-5]In the woods, is perpetual youth.[/highlight-5] Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. [highlight-6]I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.[/highlight-6]\n<div style=\"margin: 8px 0;\"></div>\nThe greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them.\n<div style=\"margin: 8px 0;\"></div>\n[highlight-7]Yet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not reside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both.[/highlight-7] It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. [highlight-8]Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.[/highlight-8] To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. [highlight-9]The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.[/highlight-9]"

      "passageHtml": "Professor Langley determines quantitatively the effects respectively produced by the radiations from the solar spots, penumbra, and photosphere upon the face of a thermopile, and infers that these effects measure their relative influence on terrestrial climate.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-1]In thus assuming that the heat communicated to the thermopile measures the solar contribution to terrestrial climate, Professor Langley omits an important factor, viz, the amount of heat absorbed in traversing the earth’s atmosphere;[/highlight-1] and in measuring the relative efficiency of the spots, penumbra, and photosphere, he has not taken into account the variations of diathermancy of the intervening atmospheric matter, which are due to the variations in the source of heat.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-2]Speaking generally, it may be affirmed that the radiations of obscure heat are more largely absorbed by the gases and vapors of our atmosphere than those of luminous heat,[/highlight-2] and the great differences in the mere luminosity of the spots, penumbra, and photosphere justify the assumption that the radiations of a sun-spot will (to use the expressive simile of Tyndall) lose far more by atmospheric sifting than will those from the photosphere. \n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-3]But the spot areas will be none the less effective on terrestrial climate on that account.[/highlight-3] A given amount of heat arrested by the earth’s atmosphere will have even greater climatic efficiency than if received upon its solid surface, inasmuch as the gases are worse radiators than the rocks, and will therefore, cæteris paribus, retain a larger proportion of the heat they receive.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-4]I have long ago endeavored to show that the depth of the photosphere, from the solar surface inwards, is limited by dissociation;[/highlight-4] that the materials of the Sun within the photosphere exist in a dissociated, elementary condition; that at the photosphere they are, for the most part, combined. This view has since been adopted by many eminent solar physicists, and if correct, demands a much higher temperature within the depths revealed by that withdrawal of the photospheric veil which constitutes a sun-spot.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-5]If I am right in this, and also in supposing the spot-radiations to be so much more abundantly absorbed than those of the photosphere, and if in spite of this higher temperature of the spots, the surface of the earth receives from them the lower degree of heat measured by Professor Langley, another interesting consequence must follow.[/highlight-5] The excess of spot-heat directly absorbed by the atmosphere, and mainly by the water dissolved or suspended in its upper regions, must be especially effective in dissipating clouds and checking or modifying their formation. The meteorological results of this may be important, and are worthy of careful study.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-6]In thus venturing to question some of Professor Langley’s inferences I am far from underrating the interest and importance of his researches.[/highlight-6] On the contrary, I regard the quantitative results he has obtained as especially valuable and opportune, in affording means of testing the above-named and other speculations in solar physics. [highlight-7]Similar observations repeated at different elevations would decide, so far as the lower regions are concerned, whether or not there is any difference in the quantity of heat imparted by the bright and obscure portions of the Sun to our atmosphere.[/highlight-7] If the differences already observed by Professor Langley vary in ascending, a new means will be afforded of studying the constitution of the interior of the Sun and its relations to the photosphere. Direct evidence of selective absorption by our atmosphere may thus be obtained, which would go far towards solving one of the crucial solar problems, viz, whether the darker regions are hotter or cooler than the photosphere.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-8]The obscure radiations from the moon must be absorbed by our atmosphere like those from the sun-spot, and may be sufficiently effective to account for the alleged dissipation of clouds by the full moon.[/highlight-8]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nIn both cases the climatic influence is greatly heightened by the fact that all the heat thus absorbed is directly effective in raising the temperature of the air. [highlight-9]The action of the absorbed heat in reference to cloud-formation is directly opposite to that of the transmitted solar heat, as this reaching the surface of the earth evaporates the superficial water, and thereby produces the material of clouds.[/highlight-9] On the other hand, the heat which is absorbed by the air increases its vapor-holding capacity, and thus prevents the formation of clouds, or even effects the dissolution of clouds already formed."

      "passageHtml": "A paper was read on March 2, 1882, by Dr. C. W. Siemens at the Royal Society, and he published an article on “A New Theory of the Sun” in the April number of the Nineteenth Century. [highlight-1]All who have read my essay on “The Fuel of the Sun” are surprised at the statement with which the magazine article opens, viz.: that this “may be termed a first attempt to open for the sun a debtor and creditor account, inasmuch as he has hitherto been regarded only as a great almoner pouring forth incessantly his boundless wealth of heat, without receiving any of it back.”[/highlight-1]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-2]Some of my friends suppose that Dr. Siemens has wilfully ignored the most important element of my theory.[/highlight-2] I am quite satisfied, however, that they are mistaken.[highlight-3]I see plainly enough that although Dr. Siemens quotes my book, he had not read it when he did so.[/highlight-3] This inference has been confirmed by subsequent correspondence with Dr. Siemens, who tells me that he saw the book some years since but had not read it.\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\nIn the meantime I will briefly state some of the points of agreement and difference between Dr. Siemens and myself. In the first place, we both take as our fundamental basis of speculation the idea of a universal extension of atmospheric matter, and we both regard this as the recipient of the diffused solar radiations, which are afterwards recovered and recondensed, or concentrated. [highlight-4]Thus our “fuel of the sun” is primarily the same, but, as will presently be seen, our machinery for feeding the solar furnace is essentially different.[/highlight-4]\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\n\nCertain [highlight-11]desiccated pedants[/highlight-11] have sneered at my title, “The Fuel of the Sun,” as “sensational,” and have refused to read the book on this account; but Dr. Sterry Hunt has provided me with ample revenge. [highlight-5]He has disentombed an interesting paper by Sir Isaac Newton, dated 1675, in which the same sensationalism is perpetrated with very small modification, Sir Isaac Newton’s title being “Solary Fuel.”[/highlight-5]\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\n\nDr. Siemens supposes that the rotation of the sun effects a sort of “fan action,” by throwing off heated atmospheric matter from his equatorial regions, which atmospheric matter is afterwards reclaimed and passed over to the polar regions of the sun. This interchange he describes as effected by the differences of pressure on the fluid envelope of the sun. [highlight-6]He maintains that this “centrifugal action, however small in amount as compared with the enormous attraction of the sun, would destroy the balance, and determine a motion towards the sun as regards the mass opposite the polar surface, and into space as regards the equatorial mass.”[/highlight-6] He adds that “the equatorial current so produced, owing to its mighty proportions, would flow outwards into space, to a practically unlimited distance.”\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\n\nIt is evident that if such fan action can bring back all the material that has received the solar radiations, and which holds them either as temperature or otherwise, the restoration and perpetuation of solar energy will be complete, for even the heat received by our earth and its brother and sister planets would still remain in the family, as they would radiate it into the interplanetary atmospheric matter supposed to be reclaimed by the sun.\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\n\nBut, as Mr. Proctor has clearly shown, [highlight-10]the rays of the sun cannot do all the work thus required for his own restoration without becoming extinguished as regards the outside universe; and if the other suns—i.e., the stars—do the same they could not be visible to us.[/highlight-10]\n[highlight-7]Thus Dr. Siemens’ theory removes our sun from his place among the stars, and renders the great problem of stellar radiation more inscrutable than ever by thus putting the evidence of our great luminary altogether out of court.[/highlight-7]\n<div style=\"margin: 30px 0;\"></div>\n\n [highlight-8]My theory, on the contrary, demands only a gradual absorption of solar and stellar rays, such as actual observation of their varying splendor indicates.[/highlight-8]\n[highlight-9]If space were absolutely transparent, and its infinite depths peopled throughout, the firmament would present to our view one continuous blazing dome, as all the spaces between the nearer stars would be filled by the infinity of radiations from the more distant.[/highlight-9]"

      "passageHtml": "What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual over himself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nEach will receive its proper share, if each has that which more particularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the part which chiefly interests society.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThough society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. [highlight-1]This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights;[/highlight-1] and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. [highlight-2]The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights.[/highlight-2] The offender may then be justly punished by opinion, though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. [highlight-3]But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of understanding).[/highlight-3] In such cases, there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-4]It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved.[/highlight-4] Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. [highlight-5]But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal sort or in the figurative shape of ridicule or sarcasm.[/highlight-5] The real evil is the want of interest in the good of others. [highlight-6]The doctrine of this essay is, that the individual is sovereign over his own body and mind, and that society has no right to interfere with him, except for the purpose of preventing harm to others.[/highlight-6]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThe only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. [highlight-7]In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute.[/highlight-7] Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\n\n[highlight-8]It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties.[/highlight-8] We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. [highlight-9]The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable.[/highlight-9] Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. [highlight-10]Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.[/highlight-10] Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. [highlight-11]But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others.[/highlight-11]"

      "passageHtml": "Wild animals live by laws as old as the earth itself—laws of instinct, survival, and adaptation that have shaped their existence long before humans walked the plains. In the vast rangelands where the wind sweeps unchecked, creatures such as the wolf, the crow, and the rabbit demonstrate remarkable intelligence and resilience. Yet these same qualities often bring them into conflict with human expansion, leading to stories of both triumph and tragedy.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nConsider Lobo, the king of Currumpaw, a wolf whose cunning made him legendary among ranchers in the late nineteenth century. For years, Lobo led his pack with unmatched strategy, avoiding traps and poisons that claimed lesser wolves. [highlight-1]His strength was not merely physical; it was mental.[/highlight-1] He learned the patterns of human behavior, discerning safe paths from dangerous ones, and taught his mates to do the same. [highlight-13]His pack hunted with precision, taking only what they needed while evading detection.[/highlight-13] [highlight-2]But as settlements grew and livestock multiplied, the balance shifted.[/highlight-2] Hunters employed every device—traps, strychnine, and relentless pursuit—to end his reign. In the end, Lobo's downfall came not from weakness but from loyalty: he refused to abandon his captured mate, leading to his capture in 1894. [highlight-3]His story illustrates how wildlife, even at its most intelligent, struggles against relentless human pressure.[/highlight-3]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nSimilar intelligence appears in less fearsome creatures. Silverspot, an old crow, ruled his band through wisdom gained over many seasons. He knew every inch of his territory—the best roosts, the safest feeding grounds, and the locations of enemies. [highlight-4]Silverspot's calls conveyed complex messages: warnings of hawks, signals for food, or alerts to approaching danger.[/highlight-4] He taught the young crows through example, showing them how to outwit owls and farmers alike. His leadership ensured the flock's survival in a world full of threats. [highlight-14]Yet even such clever birds face risks from habitat loss and indiscriminate shooting, forces that diminish their numbers year by year.[/highlight-14]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nRabbits, too, embody the quiet drama of wildlife survival. Raggylug, a young cottontail, learned early the perils of the open field. His mother trained him in camouflage, stillness, and swift evasion. [highlight-5]When pursued by foxes or hawks, he froze in place, blending with the earth, or dashed in zigzags to confuse his pursuer.[/highlight-5] His world was one of constant vigilance: every rustle might signal death, every shadow a predator. Yet rabbits thrive through sheer reproductive vigor and adaptability, colonizing new thickets when old ones are destroyed. [highlight-6]Their story reminds us that wildlife often persists not through grandeur but through humble persistence.[/highlight-6]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThese animals share a common fate in the modern era. Once abundant across prairies, forests, and mountains, many species now dwindle as wilderness gives way to farms, railroads, and cities. The passenger pigeon, once darkening the skies in flocks of millions, vanished entirely within decades due to overhunting and deforestation. [highlight-7]Bison herds that numbered in the tens of millions were reduced to a few hundred by commercial hunting.[/highlight-7] Even songbirds suffer from the drainage of wetlands and the spraying of poisons meant for crops.   [highlight-8]The loss is not merely numerical; it disrupts entire ecosystems.[/highlight-8] Predators like wolves control prey populations, preventing overgrazing; birds disperse seeds, aiding forest renewal; [highlight-15]small mammals aerate soil and serve as food for larger creatures.[/highlight-15]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nConservation offers hope. [highlight-9]Thoughtful laws, protected reserves, and public awareness can reverse declines.[/highlight-9] National parks preserve habitats where animals live undisturbed; refuges shield migratory birds; breeding programs restore diminished populations. Success stories exist: the comeback of the American bison from near-extinction shows what deliberate effort can achieve.  [highlight-10]Yet protection requires vigilance.[/highlight-10] Poaching, pollution, and climate shifts continue to threaten even guarded species.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nUltimately, wildlife teaches humility. [highlight-11]These creatures do not exist for human amusement or profit; they are fellow inhabitants of a shared planet, each playing a role in nature's intricate web.[/highlight-11] To preserve them is to preserve the balance that sustains us all. [highlight-12]As human activity reshapes the earth, the question remains: will we choose coexistence, or allow the wild chorus to fade into silence?\n[/highlight-12]"

      "passageHtml": "The human mind, that marvelous and mysterious entity, has long fascinated thinkers across centuries. It is the seat of consciousness, the origin of thought, emotion, and will, and the bridge between the material world and our inner experience. [highlight-1]Unlike the body, which we can observe and measure directly, the mind reveals itself only through its operations—perceiving, remembering, reasoning, and feeling.[/highlight-1] Yet these operations are so intimate and constant that we rarely pause to examine their nature.\n\n [highlight-2]Consider first the stream of consciousness, a term aptly coined to describe the continuous flow of thoughts and sensations that constitute our mental life. [/highlight-2]Our awareness is never static; it moves forward like a river, carrying impressions from the senses, memories from the past, anticipations of the future, and a constant undercurrent of feelings. [highlight-3]Each moment blends into the next, with no sharp divisions.[/highlight-3] What we call the \"present\" is not a knife-edge instant but a specious present—a short span of duration, perhaps a few seconds, in which we grasp a portion of time as now. [highlight-4]Beyond this lies the remembered past and the imagined future, both of which color the immediate experience.[/highlight-4]\n\nThis flowing quality of mind arises from its dependence on the brain, that organ of wondrous complexity. Every mental state has its correlative brain process; no thought occurs without some neural activity. [highlight-5]Injuries to specific brain regions can abolish vision, memory, or speech, demonstrating that the mind is not an independent spirit but intimately bound to physical conditions.[/highlight-5] Yet the mind is more than the sum of these processes. [highlight-6]It selects, attends, and integrates what the brain receives. Attention acts as a spotlight, illuminating certain sensations while dimming others; without it, the flood of sensory input would overwhelm us into chaos.[/highlight-6]\n\nPerception illustrates this integrative power vividly. When we see an object—a tree, say—we do not merely receive patches of color and shape; we perceive a unified thing with meaning. The mind supplies relations: the tree stands apart from the background, has depth, belongs to a category. [highlight-7]This act of perception involves discrimination and association.[/highlight-7] We discriminate qualities—green leaves from brown trunk—and associate them with past experiences: shade, wood, growth. [highlight-8]Association by contiguity links ideas that have occurred together in time or space; similarity connects those resembling each other. These laws govern much of our thinking, from simple recall to creative invention.[/highlight-8]\n\nMemory, too, depends on these principles. It is not a passive storehouse but an active reconstruction. We do not retrieve exact copies of past events; rather, we rebuild them from fragments, guided by cues and interest. [highlight-9]Repetition strengthens paths in the brain, making recall easier; emotion intensifies retention, so vivid joys or sorrows endure longest.[/highlight-9] Yet memory is selective—forgetting serves a purpose by clearing space for the useful and relevant. Without it, the mind would be buried under irrelevant details.\n\nReasoning builds upon perception and memory. We abstract qualities, form concepts, and draw inferences. From observing many trees, we form the general idea \"tree,\" stripping away particulars to grasp essence. [highlight-10]Judgment follows: we affirm or deny relations between ideas.[/highlight-10] The mind's capacity for abstraction allows science, philosophy, and art; without it, we would remain trapped in the concrete and immediate.\n\nEmotions add color and motive to mental life. Joy, sorrow, fear, anger—these are not mere accidents but adaptive responses. They arise from bodily changes (racing heart in fear, relaxed muscles in contentment) and in turn influence thought and action. [highlight-11]The mind feels these states as its own, weaving them into the stream of consciousness.[/highlight-11]\n\nThe self emerges from this rich interplay. We experience a core \"I\" that persists amid changing thoughts—a sense of personal identity linking yesterday's memories to today's decisions. [highlight-12]This self is not a separate entity lodged in the brain but the unity of the stream itself, felt through bodily sensations (the cephalic stirrings of thought) and emotional tones of ownership.[/highlight-12]\n\n [highlight-13]Yet the mind's nature remains partly elusive.[/highlight-13] It adapts to environment, learns from experience, and creates novelty. It dreams in sleep, imagines impossibilities, and contemplates its own existence. In moments of reflection, we glimpse its depths: the capacity for wonder, moral insight, and transcendence.  \n\n[highlight-15]In sum, the human mind is a dynamic process—selective, integrative, creative—rooted in biology yet reaching toward meaning and purpose. It is the instrument by which we know the world and ourselves, forever unfolding in the endless stream of conscious life.[/highlight-15]"
