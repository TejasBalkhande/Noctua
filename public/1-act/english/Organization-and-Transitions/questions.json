      "passageHtml": "The Silk Road was not a single highway but a vast network of interconnected trade routes that linked the East and West for over fifteen centuries. Emerging in the late second century BCE during China's Han Dynasty, it connected the ancient civilizations of China, Central Asia, India, Persia, and eventually the Roman Empire. The name \"Silk Road,\" coined much later in the 19th century by German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen, highlights the most famous commodity: Chinese silk, a luxurious fabric so prized in the West that it was worth its weight in gold.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThe origins trace back to Emperor Wu of Han, who sought alliances against the nomadic Xiongnu tribes harassing China's northern borders. [highlight-1]In 138 BCE, he sent envoy Zhang Qian westward.[/highlight-1] Captured and held for years by the Xiongnu, Zhang eventually escaped and returned with reports of fertile kingdoms in Central Asia, including Ferghana (known for its prized \"heavenly horses\") and Bactria. His journeys opened formal diplomatic and commercial paths. By around 114 BCE, regular caravans carried goods from Chang'an (modern Xi'an) through the Gansu Corridor, skirting the formidable Taklamakan Desert via oasis towns like Dunhuang and Kashgar. From there, routes branched: one northern path crossed deserts and mountains to reach Persia and the Mediterranean, while a southern route passed through the Karakoram and Hindu Kush into India and beyond.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nMerchants rarely traveled the entire length; instead, goods moved in relay trade. Sogdian traders from Central Asia became key intermediaries, establishing communities along the routes and dominating commerce from the 4th to 8th centuries CE. Caravans carried silk, porcelain, tea, jade, spices, dyes, and paper eastward from China. In return flowed glassware (a Roman specialty that fascinated the Chinese), gold, silver, wool, horses, camels, frankincense, myrrh, and precious stones like lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. [highlight-2]The routes extended to maritime paths as well, linking Chinese ports to India, Arabia, and East Africa via the Indian Ocean.[/highlight-2]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-3]In addition to material goods,[/highlight-3] Buddhism spread from India into China starting in the 1st century CE, carried by monks who built monasteries in desert oases and translated sacred texts. Nestorian Christianity reached China by the 7th century, as evidenced by ancient steles and artifacts. Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Judaism, and later Islam also traveled these paths, influencing art, language, and philosophy. Artistic styles blended: Greco-Buddhist sculptures from Gandhara combined Hellenistic realism with Indian spiritual themes, while Chinese silk techniques inspired Persian and Byzantine textiles.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThe network peaked under the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), when stability encouraged Sogdian and Persian merchants to flourish in Chang'an, and again during the Mongol Empire (13th–14th centuries). The Pax Mongolica under Genghis Khan and his successors unified vast territories, making travel safer for figures like Marco Polo, whose accounts later captivated Europe.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-4]However,[/highlight-4] decline came gradually. After the Mongol fragmentation, political instability, plagues like the Black Death (possibly spread along the routes), and the rise of the Ottoman Empire disrupted overland trade. By the 15th century, Ming China restricted foreign contact, while European mariners like Vasco da Gama opened sea routes around Africa in 1498, offering cheaper alternatives. [highlight-5]The ancient network faded, yet its legacy endures in shared technologies, religions, and cultural fusions that shaped Eurasia.[/highlight-5]"

      "passageHtml": "In the summer of 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming returned to his laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London after a brief vacation. [highlight-1]This meticulous nature, however, was part of what made his discovery so surprising.[/highlight-1] Fleming had been studying Staphylococcus bacteria, which cause infections such as boils and abscesses. He was examining a number of Petri dishes containing cultures of these bacteria when he noticed something unusual on one plate that had been left uncovered. A blob of mold had grown on the agar, and around this mold, later identified as a strain of Penicillium notatum, the bacterial colonies had failed to develop. [highlight-6]Instead of spreading across the dish, the staphylococci stopped short, creating a clear zone where no growth occurred.[/highlight-6]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nIntrigued by this accidental contamination, Fleming did not discard the plate as a failed experiment. He recognized that the mold was producing a substance capable of inhibiting bacterial growth. He carefully isolated the mold and grew it in broth, then tested the filtered liquid, what he called \"mould juice\" on various bacteria. The substance proved remarkably effective against staphylococci and other gram-positive bacteria, yet it appeared harmless to human cells in initial tests. On March 7, 1929, Fleming named this antibacterial agent \"penicillin,\" after the Penicillium mold from which it came.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nAlthough Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology later that year, the scientific community showed little immediate enthusiasm. Penicillin proved difficult to purify and unstable in large quantities, and Fleming himself could not develop it into a practical drug. He suggested its potential for treating infections or as a selective agent in lab cultures, but progress stalled for nearly a decade.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThe true medical revolution began in the late 1930s, when Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and their team at Oxford University revisited Fleming's work. They succeeded in purifying and producing penicillin in sufficient amounts for clinical trials. By 1941, the first human patients received the drug, and its success against deadly infections marked the dawn of the antibiotic era. Fleming's chance observation, often described by him as a fortunate accident, ultimately saved countless lives and transformed modern medicine, earning him a share of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."

      "passageHtml": "In late 1895, German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, then a professor at the University of Würzburg, was investigating cathode rays using a Crookes tube in his laboratory. These rays, generated by high-voltage electricity in a partially evacuated glass envelope, had already fascinated scientists for years. On the evening of November 8, Röntgen shielded the tube entirely with thick black cardboard to prevent any visible light from escaping. Unexpectedly, a barium platinocyanide screen placed nearby began to emit a faint greenish fluorescence, even though it lay several feet away and no direct light could reach it.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThis observation puzzled Röntgen. He soon confirmed that the effect persisted regardless of distance, up to two meters, and that the invisible radiation penetrated materials opaque to ordinary light. For the next seven weeks, he worked tirelessly and in near seclusion, systematically testing the rays' properties. He found that they traveled in straight lines, produced no deflection in magnetic fields, and created sharper shadows when passing through denser objects. [highlight-4]However, when he positioned his hand between the tube and the fluorescent screen, the bones appeared as dark outlines against the softer tissue—a revelation that must have been both thrilling and eerie.[/highlight-4]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nRöntgen termed the phenomenon \"X-rays,\" using the mathematical symbol for the unknown. On December 28, 1895, he submitted his first paper, \"On a New Kind of Rays,\" to the Würzburg Physico-Medical Society. [highlight-6]The brief report included photographs, notably one of his wife Bertha's hand, which displayed her bones and wedding ring with startling clarity.[/highlight-6] [2] News of the discovery spread rapidly across Europe and beyond. By January 1896, physicians were already applying X-rays to diagnose fractures and locate foreign objects in the body, marking the birth of diagnostic radiology.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[3] Röntgen's meticulous yet accidental breakthrough transformed medicine and physics overnight. He received the inaugural Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 but declined to patent his method, ensuring its free availability for humanitarian benefit. His work not only unveiled a new form of electromagnetic radiation but also paved the way for profound advances in science, from atomic structure to modern imaging techniques."

      "passageHtml": "George Orwell's Animal Farm, published in 1945, stands as one of the most incisive examples of political satire in modern literature. Subtitled \"A Fairy Story,\" the novella uses a simple barnyard setting and anthropomorphic animals to deliver a sharp critique of totalitarianism, particularly the betrayal of revolutionary ideals in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. Orwell, a democratic socialist disillusioned by the realities of Stalinism, crafted this allegory to expose how power corrupts and how propaganda distorts truth.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThe story begins on Manor Farm, where the animals, oppressed by the drunken farmer Mr. Jones, are inspired by Old Major, a wise old boar modeled after Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, to envision a rebellion. Old Major's dream of a world free from human exploitation leads to the animals' uprising, driving out Jones and renaming the farm \"Animal Farm.\" They establish Seven Commandments of Animalism, with the central principle: \"All animals are equal.\" This mirrors the egalitarian promises of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-1]The pigs, however, the cleverest animals, quickly assume leadership.[/highlight-1] Napoleon (representing Stalin) and Snowball (representing Leon Trotsky) vie for control. Through cunning manipulation, Napoleon ousts Snowball and consolidates power. He alters the commandments gradually, such as permitting the pigs to drink alcohol or sleep in beds—while Squealer, the propagandist pig (akin to Soviet spokesmen like Molotov), justifies every change with twisted logic. The animals' labor builds the windmill, symbolizing Soviet industrialization projects like the Five-Year Plans, yet the benefits accrue only to the pigs.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-2]Orwell uses several key satirical techniques to expose the pigs' hypocrisy.[/highlight-2] The pigs adopt human behaviors, walking on two legs, trading with neighboring farms—while the other animals toil in worsening conditions. The most famous line, the final corruption of the commandment to \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,\" encapsulates the hypocrisy of regimes claiming equality while enforcing hierarchy. The sheep's mindless chanting of slogans parodies propaganda, and the executions of \"traitors\" echo Stalin's purges.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nBeyond its specific allegory of the Russian Revolution, Animal Farm warns against any form of authoritarianism. Orwell highlights how revolutions begun with noble intentions can devolve into new tyrannies when leaders prioritize self-interest over collective good. The use of animals amplifies the satire: humans are reduced to \"the enemy,\" yet the pigs become indistinguishable from them, underscoring the timeless truth that power tends to corrupt absolutely.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-3]This fable remains relevant, illustrating the dangers of unchecked authority, manipulation of language, and the erosion of ideals.[/highlight-3] In fewer than 100 pages, Orwell achieves what lengthy treatises often fail to do: a clear, biting exposure of political deception through humor, irony, and stark simplicity."

It introduces a surprising or contrasting piece of information within the sequence. \"For instance\" would be incorrect because the hand is not an example of the previous statements, but the most dramatic among them. \"In contrast\" and \"Furthermore\" do not fit the logical relationship."

Placing highlighted sentence before this final line creates a classic and effective structure: state the broader significance, then end with a powerful, specific closing thought. Moving highlighted sentence to the very end (Option B) allows the essay to conclude on a high note about Orwell's masterful execution."
