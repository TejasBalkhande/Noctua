      "passageHtml": "The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg stands as one of the most transformative achievements in human history, bridging the medieval world with the dawn of the modern era. Born around 1397 in Mainz, Germany, to a patrician family his father Friele Gensfleisch and mother Else Wyrich Gutenberg grew up amid social and political unrest. [highlight-1]The family's name change to Gutenberg, meaning \"good mountain,\" reflected efforts to distance themselves from controversy.[/highlight-1] Educated likely for the church, young Johannes showed an early aptitude for mechanical arts, influenced by his father's work in metal and coinage. By the 1430s, after periods of exile and travel, he settled in Strasburg, where authentic records first link him to innovative pursuits.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nIn Strasburg, Gutenberg experimented with what would become typography. [highlight-2]A 1439 lawsuit provides key insights:[/highlight-2] he partnered with goldsmith Andreas Dritzehn and others in a secretive venture involving \"arts and trades.\" Witnesses testified to tools divided into four pieces likely referring to an adjustable type mold and materials like lead that were melted down. This secrecy surrounded Gutenberg's breakthrough: movable metal types cast in molds, a departure from earlier block-printing methods. Unlike wooden blocks used for images or fabrics, which were carved as fixed pages and limited to [highlight-5]small runs[/highlight-5], Gutenberg's system allowed letters to be individually cast, arranged, inked, and reprinted efficiently. He refined an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony for durability, adapted screw presses from wine-making for even impression, and developed oil-based ink from soot and varnish for sharp adhesion on paper.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nReturning to Mainz around 1448, Gutenberg secured funding from moneylender Johann Fust to scale his invention. Their collaboration produced the iconic 42-line Bible, completed by 1455 [highlight-4]a two-volume folio of 1,282 pages[/highlight-4] with elegant Gothic types, rubricated initials, and woodcut borders. Printed on fine paper or vellum, it exemplified typography's superiority: uniform letters, reusable types, and potential for large editions. Yet financial woes plagued Gutenberg; unable to repay Fust's loans, he lost a 1455 lawsuit, surrendering his press, types, and stock. Fust and his son-in-law Peter Schoeffer continued the work, issuing refined editions like the 1457 Psalter.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nGutenberg persisted modestly, printing indulgences, calendars, and pamphlets like the 1460 Catholicon until his death in 1468, impoverished but honored as a courtier by Archbishop Adolph II. His invention's impact was immediate: by 1500, presses operated across Europe, producing over 20 million books. This democratized knowledge, fueling the Renaissance, Reformation, and scientific inquiry. No longer confined to monastic scriptoria, ideas spread rapidly, challenging authorities and empowering the masses. [highlight-3]Gutenberg's genius lay not in isolated components presses or inks existed before but in synthesizing them into a practical, scalable system that forever altered communication and culture.[/highlight-3]"

      "passageHtml": "Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. “Buzz” Aldrin, and Michael Collins awoke to start their fifth day in space at the end of their ninth revolution around the Moon. After a quick breakfast, Aldrin and Armstrong began re-activating the Lunar Module (LM) Eagle, including deploying its landing gear, and donned their pressure suits. Near the end of the 12th orbit around the Moon, Capcom Charles M. Duke radioed up to Apollo 11 that they were GO to undock. [highlight-1]The event took place behind the Moon during the start of their 13th revolution, the astronauts filming each other’s spacecraft as they began their independent flights.[/highlight-1] After they reappeared from behind the Moon, Armstrong radioed their status to MCC saying, “The Eagle has wings.” Collins in the Command Module (CM) Columbia observed, “I think you’ve got a fine looking flying machine there, Eagle, despite the fact you’re upside down,” [highlight-6]prompting Armstrong to reply, “Somebody’s upside down.”[/highlight-6]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-2]Later during the 13th orbit, about 10 minutes before Apollo 11 disappeared again behind the Moon, Duke radioed up the GO for Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI). The DOI burn, a 30-second firing of the LM’s Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine took place behind the Moon, lowering the low point of Eagle’s orbit to about 50,000 feet. The two craft now flying separately reappeared from behind the Moon on their 14th orbit. Duke radioed up the GO for Powered Descent Initiation (PDI), the beginning of the landing maneuver.[/highlight-2]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nAt the beginning of PDI, the LM’s DPS engine ran at 10% thrust for 26 seconds for a smooth initial deceleration before increasing to full thrust. Eagle was flying engine first and windows facing down toward the Moon’s surface and was about 300 miles east of the landing site in the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong tracked landmarks as they passed over them against the predicted times. Based on Eagle passing landmarks about two to three seconds early, Armstrong predicted that they would land about three miles further downrange than planned – [highlight-5]and he was proved correct.[/highlight-5]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-4]At about 33,000-foot altitude, Armstrong and Aldrin were surprised by the first 1202 program alarm, which they had not seen in simulations. [/highlight-4]After a few seconds of analysis in MCC, Duke gave them a GO to proceed. Similar alarms followed, but they continued the descent. [highlight-3]At about 600 feet, noticing Eagle’s computer was taking them down into a boulder-strewn area near West Crater, Armstrong took over manual control of the descent.[/highlight-3] With fuel low and dust kicking up, at precisely 3:17:40 PM Houston time on July 20, 1969, they touched down. Armstrong responded with the historic words, “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.”"

      "passageHtml": "Sleep is a complex, active process essential for physical restoration, cognitive function, and emotional well-being. [highlight-1]Far from being a passive state of unconsciousness, it consists of repeating cycles that alternate between non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.[/highlight-1] A typical night's sleep includes four to six such cycles, each lasting about 90 to 110 minutes.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nNon-REM sleep comprises three stages, progressing from light to deep slumber. Stage 1 is a brief transitional phase, lasting only a few minutes, where the body relaxes, breathing slows, and brain waves begin to shift from the alert patterns of wakefulness to slower theta waves. Muscle activity decreases, and it is easy to awaken at this point. Stage 2 occupies the largest portion of non-REM sleep; here, brain waves include distinctive bursts called sleep spindles and K-complexes, which help protect sleep from minor disturbances and support memory consolidation. Heart rate and body temperature continue to drop.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-2]The deepest phase, Stage 3 (also called slow-wave or delta sleep), features large, slow delta waves.[/highlight-2] This stage is crucial for physical recovery: the body repairs tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens the immune system. Growth hormone is released predominantly during this time. Waking someone from deep non-REM sleep often results in grogginess and disorientation, known as sleep inertia.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nAfter progressing through these non-REM stages, the brain transitions into REM sleep, the phase most closely associated with vivid dreaming. REM sleep is characterized by rapid, darting eye movements beneath closed eyelids, irregular breathing, elevated heart rate, and brain activity resembling wakefulness yet the body experiences temporary muscle atonia (paralysis), preventing acting out dreams. [highlight-3]The first REM period is short, perhaps 10 minutes, but subsequent ones lengthen, with the final REM episodes occupying up to an hour toward morning.[/highlight-3]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nDreams during REM sleep tend to be intense, emotional, and narrative-driven, often incorporating bizarre elements or heightened emotions. [highlight-4]While some dreaming occurs in non-REM sleep, those experiences are typically more thought-like, less vivid, and tied to daily concerns.[/highlight-4] The increasing duration of REM as the night progresses explains why morning dreams feel longer and more elaborate.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThese cycles are regulated by two main systems: the circadian rhythm, our internal 24-hour clock influenced by light and darkness, and sleep homeostasis, the accumulating \"pressure\" to sleep the longer we stay awake. Disruptions to either such as shift work, jet lag, or irregular schedules can fragment cycles and impair health.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nUnderstanding sleep and dream cycles highlights why consistent, sufficient rest matters. Adequate time in both non-REM and REM stages supports learning, creativity, mood regulation, and overall resilience. [highlight-5]Prioritizing sleep hygiene ensures these natural rhythms unfold effectively, allowing the brain and body to recharge fully.[/highlight-5]"

      "passageHtml": "During World War II, as nations raced to gain intelligence advantages, thousands of women stepped into one of the most secretive and intellectually demanding roles of the conflict: codebreaking. In the United States, the Army and Navy secretly recruited more than 10,000 women—many from elite colleges such as Wellesley, Smith, and Barnard, as well as from small towns and teaching positions across the country. Recruiters often approached promising students with discreet questions: Did they enjoy crossword puzzles? Were they engaged to be married? Those who answered yes to the first and no to the second were invited to join a classified effort that would prove vital to Allied victory. [highlight-1]They were told that their work would require intense focus and absolute secrecy.[/highlight-1]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nThese women, frequently called \"Code Girls,\" relocated to Washington, D.C., where they worked at Arlington Hall for the Army and at the Naval Security Station for the Navy. Trained in cryptanalysis, they deciphered enemy communications, operated complex machines to break codes like Japan's Purple cipher and Germany's naval Enigma variations, and analyzed intercepted messages that revealed troop movements, submarine positions, and battle plans. Their labor shortened the war by providing actionable intelligence that saved countless lives. Sworn to lifelong secrecy, many never spoke of their contributions, even to family, until declassification decades later.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\nAcross the Atlantic, at Britain's Bletchley Park, women formed the majority of the workforce—outnumbering men significantly. Members of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS, or Wrens) and other units operated Bombe machines to crack Enigma-encrypted messages, translated decoded German text, and supported the Ultra intelligence program that informed critical decisions, from the Battle of the Atlantic to D-Day preparations. [highlight-3]Women like those in Hut 6 and Hut 8 tackled daily rotor settings and pattern recognition under immense pressure, often working rotating shifts in crowded, windowless blocks.[/highlight-3]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n\n[highlight-4]Though their work remained hidden for years, these women demonstrated extraordinary skill in mathematics, languages, logic, and persistence.[/highlight-4] They shattered stereotypes about women's intellectual capabilities while helping turn the tide of war. [highlight-5]Their legacy reminds us that behind many historic victories stand unsung contributors whose dedication and brilliance made all the difference.[/highlight-5]"

This sentence provides an important contrast by briefly describing what non-REM dreaming is like, thereby strengthening the reader's understanding of REM dreams by comparison. It adds useful context. Option D is incorrect; the paragraph is about dreaming in general, using REM as the primary focus."

      "explanationHtml": "The sentence is a helpful addition. It directly follows the recruiters' questions and explains the purpose behind them. Asking about crossword puzzles was a way to gauge logical thinking and focus, while asking about marriage was to ensure the women had no immediate personal ties that might conflict with the need for absolute secrecy and relocation. Option (A) correctly identifies this clarifying purpose. The other options are incorrect: (B) is wrong because the sentence doesn't mention living conditions; (C) is wrong because it supports, rather than contradicts, the theme of secrecy; and (D) is wrong because it directly relates to the recruitment context."

Option (C) correctly identifies this illustrative purpose. Option (A) is incorrect because it provides new, specific details rather than repeating information. Option (B) is incorrect because describing the conditions is part of illustrating the reality of their work, not just to be negative. Option (D) is incorrect because the passage does not set up a competition between the two groups."
