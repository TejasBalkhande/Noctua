      "passageHtml": "For centuries, cartography was as much an art as it was a science. [highlight-1]Early mapmakers, or cartographers, often had to depend on fragmentary reports from explorers and travelers, which were not always reliable.[/highlight-1] A single sailor's tall tale about a sea monster or a mythical kingdom could, and often did, end up etched onto official charts for generations. This practice led to some [highlight-2]pretty interesting[/highlight-2] mistakes, like the persistent depiction of the non-existent Island of California. [highlight-3]The shift toward a more standardized and mathematically precise approach to mapping began during the Age of Enlightenment.[/highlight-3] This era's emphasis on reason and empirical evidence fundamentally changed the cartographer's task.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\n[highlight-4]The primary goal was no longer to simply create a visually stunning artifact but to produce a tool for accurate navigation and scientific record-keeping.[/highlight-4] This move towards precision was [highlight-5]a huge deal[/highlight-5] for explorers. [highlight-6]Figures like James Cook, for instance, used advanced chronometers and new triangulation techniques to create remarkably accurate charts of the Pacific, which dramatically reduced the risk of long-distance sea travel.[/highlight-6] The legacy of this transition is the modern world map, a testament to the power of combining systematic observation with the age-old human desire to picture our place in the world."

      "passageHtml": "[highlight-1]In recent years, urban community gardens have sprouted up in cities across the country.[/highlight-1] These verdant spaces, often carved out of vacant lots or nestled between tenement buildings, offer more than just a source of fresh produce. [highlight-2]They function as vital social hubs, bringing together a diverse mix of residents who might not otherwise interact.[/highlight-2] For elderly immigrants, a garden plot can be a tangible link to their homeland, while for children born in the city, it can be a [highlight-3]mind-blowing[/highlight-3] first encounter with where food actually comes from.\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\nBeyond the social benefits, these gardens can also play a significant role in urban ecology. They help to mitigate the \"heat island\" effect, absorb stormwater runoff, and provide habitats for pollinators like bees and butterflies. The positive impact these spaces have on a neighborhood is [highlight-4]amazing[/highlight-4]. [highlight-5]Consequently, many city planners now view community gardens not as a temporary use for vacant land, but as an essential component of a healthy urban infrastructure.[/highlight-5] They are key to building more resilient and vibrant communities, and [highlight-6]that's pretty much a fact[/highlight-6]."

      "passageHtml": "In an age of near-total digital dominance, where millions of songs are accessible with a simple tap on a screen, the vinyl record has staged an unexpected and powerful comeback. This analog format, once thought to be [highlight-1]totally obsolete[/highlight-1], has found a new and devoted audience among younger generations. What explains the appeal of a technology that requires careful handling, offers only about twenty minutes of music per side, and can be hampered by pops and hisses? [highlight-2]The answer lies not just in nostalgia but in the distinct and, for many, superior experience it provides.[/highlight-2]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\nListening to a record is a [highlight-3]hands-on[/highlight-3] experience that demands a certain kind of attention. You carefully slide the disc from its sleeve, place it on the platter, and gently lower the tonearm. This ritualistic process stands in stark contrast to the ephemeral nature of a streaming playlist. Furthermore, the large album covers provide a canvas for visual art that is [highlight-4]totally lost[/highlight-4] in a tiny digital thumbnail. This tangible connection to the music, from the physical object to the warm, analog sound, creates a feeling of intimacy and engagement that digital files, for all their convenience, [highlight-5]just can't replicate[/highlight-5]."

      "passageHtml": "[highlight-1]It's no secret that companies put a ton of thought into the colors they use for their logos, products, and advertising.[/highlight-1] This is because color is a powerful, silent form of communication that can significantly influence consumer behavior. The field of color psychology [highlight-2]examines[/highlight-2] how different hues affect our perceptions and emotions. For instance, blue is often associated with trust, dependability, and calmness, which is why it is a favorite for banks and tech companies. [highlight-3]In contrast, red is a high-energy color that can create a sense of urgency, making it a common choice for clearance sales.[/highlight-3]\n<div style=\"margin: 10px 0;\"></div>\nHowever, the impact of color is not universal; it is heavily mediated by cultural context and personal experience. [highlight-4]While white symbolizes purity and weddings in many Western cultures, it is the color of mourning in parts of East Asia.[/highlight-4] [highlight-5]This just goes to show that a marketing team can't simply pick a color based on a one-size-fits-all guide.[/highlight-5] A successful color strategy [highlight-6]requires[/highlight-6] a deep understanding of a target audience's cultural background. Ultimately, the most effective use of color is one that aligns a brand's identity with the expectations and values of [highlight-7]the people it's trying to reach[/highlight-7]."

      "explanationHtml": "This question asks for the most effective and professional expression.
